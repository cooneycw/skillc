# Word-boundaried on both sides so "latest" / "contested" do not match.
#
# The scan covers the command's WORDS AND FILE NAMES, NOT ITS DIRECTORIES

# cost accepted; #704 only moved fixtures out of its way. But the finish plan's
# own typecheck fallback embeds `_CPP_ROOT`, and a flow worktree is named for

# a test step with no summary and the gate into `warn`, a local verdict CI (at
# a different path) could never see. A directory name is not evidence that a

# Reading the command as WORDS, not as a string (issue #1298)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The #1294 regexes above work on the raw string, and two misreads survived
# them. A quoted `-c` script that starts with a path
# (`bash -c "/opt/venv/bin/pytest /tmp/cases"`) looked like ONE filename, so
# only "cases" was read and a real pytest run was not a test step - its
# all-skipped summary went unqualified. And `_` is a word boundary to the hint,
# so the NAME in `PYTEST_WORKERS=4 make lint` read as "pytest": lint became a
# test step, which switches OFF its #1027 examined-nothing check (coverage is
# parsed only for non-test steps).
#
# So the command is split with shlex - quoting only, the way a POSIX shell
# splits words - and each word is judged on its own:
#
#   NAME=value     an assignment, and ONLY a word matching
#                  ^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*= is one. It says what a variable
#                  holds, not what runs, so neither half is evidence.
#                  `--junitxml=report-test.xml` and `-k=test_foo` are not
#                  assignments and are read normally.
#   <shell> -c S   S is a SCRIPT (found past the shell's options, including
#                  `-o pipefail`), split into words once more. The bound is ONE
#                  level: a `-c` script inside that one is not split again but
#                  scanned raw, which can only err toward "test".
#   a word that starts like a path    its basename (the #1294 rule).
#   any other word holding spaces     the #1294 word-level strip - it is a
#                  non-shell script (`python -c "import pytest; ..."`).
#
# NOTHING IS EXECUTED and there is no shell interpreter here: no expansion, no
# aliases or functions, no eval, no heredocs. Unsupported and stated: a
# `$VAR` expansion is read as its literal text; a `-c` script nested past depth
# one is scanned raw; a non-shell quoted argument that starts with a path keeps
# only its last component.
#
# UNPARSEABLE FAILS TOWARD "TEST". shlex raises on an unbalanced quote and on
# some quoting bash accepts (`$'...'`). The fallback is the hint regex over the
# RAW command, directories included. The worst it can do is make a step expect
# a summary it does not print - a visible warning, the pre-#1294 shape - and it
# can never hide a runner. The opposite fallback would turn a parse error into
# exactly the silent green #621 exists to prevent.

# A quality gate is a step whose SKIP means the run verified nothing about some

# the #628 false green, so the runner names skipped gates and
# flow-finish-gate.sh reports `warn` rather than flattening the run to `ok`.
#
# DERIVED from the step declarations above, never hand-written (issue #890).
# The literal it replaces said {"lint", "test", "typecheck"} and omitted
# `security_scan` for three releases. That omission was not a typo - it was a
# CATEGORICAL reading of the word "gate" (the three #617 quality gates) rather
# than an answer to the question the set is actually consulted for. The two
# readings agree for lint/test/typecheck and disagree for security_scan, whose
# skip_if is `! python3 -c 'import lib.security'`: it skips exactly when the
# scanner is not installed, which is precisely when a warn is warranted. A
# containerised session has no CPP checkout, so it could run its gate, skip the
# security scan and report a bare `ok`.
#
# Deriving it is what makes a repeat impossible rather than merely corrected:
# there is no second place to update, so a gate cannot be declared and left out
# of the set. What deriving CANNOT catch is a new step that never declares
# `gate=` at all and silently takes the default - so that is pinned separately,
# by an exhaustive classification test over the verification plans
# (tests/test_runner.py::TestGateDeclarationIsExhaustive), which fails on a step
# in neither bucket AND on an exemption for a step that no longer exists.

    in its own right - cost ONE make invocation between them and are answered
    from the same database. Two invocations could disagree with each other.

    ASKS MAKE RATHER THAN READING THE MAKEFILE, and that is the whole of issue
    #1165. A textual reader cannot evaluate `ifeq`, `ifdef`, `include` or
    variable expansion, so it reports prerequisites make will never run.
    Measured on a fixture whose `verify: lint` sits inside `ifeq (1,0)`:

        textual reader -> ['lint', 'test', 'typecheck']
        make -p -n     -> verify: test typecheck
        make -n verify -> runs test, typecheck; lint never runs

    Subsumption built on the first marks `lint` covered, and a BROKEN LINT then
    passes as a `subsumed` gate - a false green produced by a cost fix.

    A better textual parser is the same defect one conditional at a time, and a
    textual reader consulted ALONGSIDE make is that defect with a quorum: every
    case where the two differ is a case where the text is wrong, and wrong in
    the unsafe direction. So the text is not consulted here at all.

    `-p` rather than `-n`: `-n` prints RECIPES, and mapping recipe lines back to
    target names is a second inference. `-p` prints the rule database with
    conditionals already resolved, so the rule is read rather than
    reconstructed. EXPLICIT rules only - an implicit or pattern-derived match is
    not a statement that these prerequisites run for this target.

    THE COST, STATED: `make -p -n` parses the target makefile, and `$(shell ...)`
    executes AT PARSE TIME - confirmed, one execution under these flags. That
    cost has a bound worth knowing: the gate is about to run `make verify` in
    this same tree, which parses the same makefile and runs the same `$(shell)`.
    This front-runs one parse; it introduces no side effect the run was not
    already going to have.

    query must agree or nothing is subsumed.

    THE NET IS MUCH WIDER THAN THE TWO HAZARDS ABOVE (issue #1192). EVERY
    include form is refused, and that includes ones neither hazard describes.

        include config.mk              -> 'line N: an include'

    An `-include` of an optional env file is ordinary project configuration,
    not recursive make and not a flag-sensitive conditional. Such a repository
    pays every gate twice, and #1152's dedup - whose measured saving was 390s
    down to 233s - never reaches it.

    THIS REPOSITORY CANNOT OBSERVE THAT. CPP's own Makefile returns None: it is
    inside the grammar, it benefits from the dedup, and so the population that
    would notice the bound is exactly the population that does not run this
    code. A different repository had to surface it. That is why the refusal is
    now REPORTED by the runner and the finish gate (`subsumption_refusals`,
    `SUBSUMPTION REFUSED`) rather than left to whoever thinks to call this
    function: a bound nobody can see from inside the tree it is maintained in
    is discoverable only by accident.

    THE REFUSAL IS CORRECT AND STAYS WIDE. Refusing costs a duplicate run;
    accepting wrongly costs the thing the gate exists for. Admitting an
    `include` of a VARIABLE would query a tree whose included CONTENT was never
    inspected - `_reads_makeflags` reads the top-level makefile only and says
    so - and admitting only a statically resolvable include is safe precisely
    because it excludes the variable form, so it would not reach the consumer
    that motivated the issue. Either the admission is unsafe or it is useless.

    OSCILLATION TRIGGER, pre-committed rather than decided later under
    pressure: what would move this bound is NOT a consumer asking for it. It is
    someone making an included file's contents statically VERIFIABLE. If that
    lands, the admission widens because the verification widened - never the
    reverse.

#: step run the same check the aggregate's prerequisite runs? - is not decidable
#: in general from a shell string. Two shapes exist in this repository and both
#: are genuinely equivalent where the question arises:
#:
#:   `make lint`
#:   `if grep -q "^lint:" Makefile 2>/dev/null; then make lint; else <alt>; fi`
#:
#: The second runs `make lint` exactly when a `lint:` target exists - and
#: subsumption only arises when make NAMED lint a prerequisite, which requires
#: that target. Anything else is reported by name WITH its command, so the
#: duplicate run explains itself and the allowlist grows from evidence rather
#: than from guessing.
#: HORIZONTAL whitespace only, and the WHOLE command must match. `\s` spans
#: newlines, so `make\nlint` - two shell commands - satisfied the direct form;
#: and the conditional form matched a PREFIX, so `... && false; then make lint;
#: else exit 1; fi` and a trailing `; exit 1` were both accepted. Suppressing
#: such a step removes a failure the aggregate cannot reproduce (counter-model
#: review).
