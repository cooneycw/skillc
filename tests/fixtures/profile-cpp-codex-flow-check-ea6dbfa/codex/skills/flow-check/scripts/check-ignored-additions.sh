#!/bin/bash
# check-ignored-additions.sh - Warn when a working-tree file is git-ignored
# but looks like an intentional source addition (the blanket-ignore trap).
#
# Motivation: .gitignore uses blanket rules with hand-maintained negation
# allow-lists (e.g. `*.json` + `!package.json` + `!renovate.json`, or the
# `.dockerignore *.md` incident in agentic-asst #452). When you author a new
# file the repo *should* track, `git add` silently no-ops - nothing fails
# until someone notices the file never got committed. This guard makes that
# loud instead of silent.
#
# Strategy: `git status --ignored=matching` lists every ignored file
# individually (it does NOT collapse whole ignored directories the way the
# default mode does, so a file in a brand-new all-ignored directory is still
# seen). We then drop the usual scratch/build noise by scanning each path
# component against a known set of cache/venv/build dir names, plus a few
# scratch file patterns. We also drop a short allow-list of files that are
# git-ignored BY DESIGN (env-only, per-machine runtime state that can never be
# an intended source addition) so the guard stops crying wolf on them every run
# (issue #504). What remains is an ignored file sitting in a tracked source
# area - the trap - which we warn about. Near-zero false positives against
# normal venv/cache noise.
#
# Usage:
#   check-ignored-additions.sh [--strict | --advisory]
#
# Options:
#   --strict    Exit 3 when suspicious ignored files are found, anywhere.
#   --advisory  Always exit 0, just print the warning.
#   (neither)   Depends on WHERE it runs (issue #1258):
#                 - a LINKED WORKTREE blocks (exit 3). A flow worktree is
#                   created clean from a tracked tree, so a non-scratch ignored
#                   file in it was written during that worktree's life - the
#                   run's own addition, which is the class that ships a hole: a
#                   clean clone will not have the file (#1144 shipped a runtime
#                   manifest this way, and `/project:next` raised on every clean
#                   clone while the author's tree passed everything).
#                 - the PRIMARY checkout stays advisory (exit 0): years of local
#                   clutter live there legitimately, and a guard that blocked on
#                   it would be routed around.
#               "In a linked worktree" is a proxy for "this run wrote it", not
#               proof - so the message names the cost rather than asserting
#               intent, and --advisory is the override.
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean (or advisory), 2 usage, 3 findings while blocking,
# 4 the ignored-file inventory could NOT be read while blocking - never 0,
# because an unread inventory and an empty one are different answers.
#
# Output:
#   Prints a "[flow] WARNING" (advisory) or "[flow] ERROR" (blocking) block
#   listing suspicious ignored files with a remediation hint, then
#   CHECK_IGNORED_ADDITIONS_MODE=<blocking|advisory> on stderr. Prints nothing
#   (exit 0) when clean.
