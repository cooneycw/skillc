"""Run mypy on the repository's DECLARED scope, else on `.` (issue #1258).

Invoked by the finish/check plans' typecheck fallback as

    python3 <cpp>/lib/cicd/mypy_scope.py uv run --extra dev mypy

and runs that command unchanged when the active mypy config declares
``files``, or with ``.`` appended when it does not. mypy reads ``files`` from
its own config when given no paths, so a declared scope is honoured by passing
none.

WHY A FILE AND NOT INLINE SHELL. The fallback slot of a generated gate command
may not contain ``;``, ``&``, ``|`` or a backtick - `command_runs_make_target`
refuses a slot that could chain, because it is the one place caller text reaches
an accepted command. A shell probe needs all of those, so it cost the typecheck
gate its subsumption under `make verify` and ran it twice. This is one plain
command. Run by PATH, never ``-m``: ``-m`` needs PYTHONPATH, which the runner
strips from child steps on purpose (#534).

THE RULE is the same one `models.MYPY_DECLARED_FILES_PROBE` encodes for
generated Makefiles (which must be self-contained, so cannot call this file):
the FIRST of mypy.ini, .mypy.ini, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg that carries a
``[mypy]`` / ``[tool.mypy]`` section is the active config, as in mypy itself; a
``files`` key in that section is a declared scope. tests/test_runner.py runs
both implementations over the same cases so they cannot drift.

Stdlib only and line-based (no tomllib): the host ``python3`` may predate 3.11.
