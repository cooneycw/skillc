"""Test-runner outcome parsing for the deterministic CI/CD runner.

A test step's success is decided by its process exit code, and every mainstream
test runner exits 0 when it ran nothing at all - pytest exits 0 when all of its
tests skipped. So the ``finish`` gate, whose whole contract is answering "is this
safe to merge?", reported an unqualified SUCCESS for a suite that executed none
of the tests that could have said no (issue #621, observed on flow:auto #65 in
agentic-poker: ``312 passed, 66 skipped`` where the 66 were the acceptance
tests).

This module turns a runner's summary line back into counts so the step result can
carry them. It is deliberately read-only and advisory: it changes what a step
REPORTS, never whether it passed. A summary it cannot recognize yields ``None``
and behaviour is unchanged.
