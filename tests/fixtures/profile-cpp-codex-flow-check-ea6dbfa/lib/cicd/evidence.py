"""Durable per-skill execution evidence over the runner's own step records (issue #1366).

WHY THIS EXISTS. The runner's state file (``.claude/runs/<run_id>.json``) is a
RESUME file: ``RunState.cleanup()`` deletes it the moment a run succeeds, so after
a green ``/flow:check`` nothing survives that a reader could inspect - only the
agent's own table saying it passed. This module keeps a small, machine-readable
record of what the runner actually executed, written by the helper rather than by
the agent, so an auditor or CI can inspect coverage without replaying the agent.

WHAT IT IS NOT. A local, writable file is INSPECTABLE EVIDENCE, not tamper-proof
attestation: anyone with write access to the git directory can edit it. It is a
CPP USAGE record, deliberately distinct from skillc's independently assembled
evaluation verdict (skillc #249) - skillc observes it as one input under its own
authority, and ordinary CI re-runs the relevant checks under its own. Nothing here
calls a model or the network; the cost is bounded file I/O.

OPT-IN, BY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE. ``CPP_EXECUTION_EVIDENCE=<skill>`` turns it on
for one invocation. An env var rather than a CLI flag for the #769 reason: callers
resolve whatever CPP checkout is installed, an older runner ignores an unknown env
var, and an older argparse REJECTS an unknown flag before any gate runs.

STORAGE AND RETENTION. ``<git-common-dir>/cpp-evidence/<skill>/<invocation>.json``.
The COMMON dir, like the friction log (#471), so a record written inside a flow
worktree survives that worktree's removal; it is never inside the working tree, so
it is never committed and never changes the tree signature it records. The newest
``RETAIN`` records per skill are kept; older ones are pruned on each terminal write.
``CPP_EXECUTION_EVIDENCE_EXPORT=<dir>`` additionally writes a copy there (a CI
artifact directory, say) - the minimal opt-in export path. Nothing is committed
unless a user copies it somewhere tracked.

FACT SOURCES ARE SEPARATED. ``observed`` is what this helper measured (HEAD, tree
signature, per-check status, exit, timestamps, population, digests, its own
version). ``declared`` is what the CALLER said through the environment (which skill
it was running, from which source, under which parent invocation) - recorded, never
verified, and labelled as such.
