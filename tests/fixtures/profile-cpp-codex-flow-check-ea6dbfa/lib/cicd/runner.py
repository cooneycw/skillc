"""Deterministic CI/CD runner.

Replaces prompt-driven orchestration with a state-machine that executes
steps sequentially, persists state to disk, and supports resume from
the last failed step.

Flow commands (.md prompts) become thin wrappers that invoke this runner
and only re-engage the LLM when code fixes are needed.

    python -m lib.cicd run --plan finish
    python -m lib.cicd run --plan deploy
    python -m lib.cicd resume <run_id>

    UID-SCOPED, and that is the whole change from the old `/tmp/uv-cache`

    directory is pre-creatable by any other local user on the host, and a
    package cache is executable content - whoever owns the directory decides
    what `uv` unpacks out of it on the next run.

    Unlike the deploy lock in `lib/cicd/deploy/guardrails.py`, which is
    deliberately shared and is hardened at the open instead, a cache has no
    cross-process contract to preserve, so scoping it costs nothing.

    STABLE across calls on purpose: `tempfile.mkdtemp()` would clear the same
    finding and silently turn every run into a cold download, with nothing else
    going red. `tests/test_runner.py` pins both properties.

    Still under the temp dir rather than `~/.cache`: the reason the default
    exists at all is that a sandboxed `~/.cache` is read-only (#534).

    THE UID SUFFIX ALONE IS NOT THE FIX, and saying so was the first version's
    mistake (counter-model review, #1113). `/tmp/uv-cache-1000` is every bit as
    predictable as `/tmp/uv-cache`; a uid in the name says who SHOULD own it,
    not who does. Any other local user can still create that exact directory
    first and own what `uv` unpacks out of it. So the name is only half of it
