"""Typed task manifest with Pydantic v2 validation.

Defines the schema for `.claude/cicd_tasks.yml` - a declarative manifest
that lets projects customize CI/CD plans and steps without modifying code.

The manifest is separate from `cicd.yml` (which handles build/health/pipeline config)
to avoid breaking changes. When present, the runner loads plans from the manifest;
when absent, it falls back to built-in defaults.

Schema:
    version: "1"
    steps:
      lint:
        command: "make lint"
        timeout: 300
        ...
    plans:
      finish:
        steps: [lint, test, security_scan]
      deploy:
        steps: [security_scan, deploy]

    `also` carries the plan's NON-gate members, which have no declaration to
