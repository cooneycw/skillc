#
#: GATE-LIB-SENTINEL
#: NEGATIVE-CONTROL: controls/gate-lib
#
# FIRST SLICE OF #1061. Nothing sources this yet, and that is deliberate: the
# module is a class-X instrument by ADR 0008's bound - its verdict is consumed
# by every gate that migrates onto it and re-derived by none - and constraint 2
# of #1061 says a SHARED FAIL-OPEN REACHES EVERY CALLER AT ONCE. So the control
# lands first, before anything depends on it, rather than as a follow-up.
#
# CONTRACT (sourced)
#   gate_map        <verdict>=<code>...   declare THIS gate's exit mapping
#   gate_arg_value  <flag> <argc> <cand>  parse one value-taking flag
#   gate_emit       <KEY> <verdict> [..]  the contract line
#   gate_exit       <verdict>             exit per the declared map
#
# CONTRACT (executed)
#   sh gate-lib.sh --check <case-dir>
#   exit 0  GATE_LIB: ok      - the case's probe completed under sh AND bash
#   exit 1  GATE_LIB: refused - the module refused, identically in both shells
#   exit 2  GATE_LIB: unknown - the shells disagreed, the probe died without a
#           refusal, or the comparison could not be made. NOT a pass.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS - three measurements, not a preference (all on 778ad82)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. ZERO SHELL SCRIPTS IN THIS REPOSITORY SOURCE A SIBLING. `grep -lE
#    '^\s*(source|\.) ' scripts/*.sh` returns nothing. 13 files carry `shift 2`
#    across 56 occurrences, and the rule "a value-taking flag given as the final
#    argument must not be silently empty" is written FIVE different ways:
#    `${2:?msg}`, `${2:-}` plus `|| die_usage`, `shift 2 || shift`, an explicit
#    `[ $# -ge 2 ]`, and a `require_value` helper. #992 was ONE defect found six
#    times and fixed six times; the shape is still copied.
#
# 2. THE EXIT MAPPING ALREADY DISAGREES. `shellcheck-gate.sh` and
#    `npm-global-upgrade.sh` use 2 for unknown; `flow-driver-retirement-check.sh`
#    uses 3 and records that its 3 doubles as a usage error. Consumers read those
#    numbers TODAY, so this module does NOT unify them - `gate_map` is per gate.
#    What moves in here is the INVARIANT the headers state in prose and nothing
#    enforces: no verdict but the good one may map to the good exit.
#
# 3. `${2:?}` - the guard #992 measured as "exit 1" - IS SHELL-DEPENDENT.
#       printf 'set -u\nV="${2:?needs a value}"\n' > p.sh
#       bash p.sh --flag  -> 1        dash p.sh --flag  -> 2
#    On the real gate, same file, same argument:
#       bash scripts/shellcheck-gate.sh --root  -> 1
#       sh   scripts/shellcheck-gate.sh --root  -> 2
#    That file declares `exit 1 = findings`, so under bash a USAGE ERROR REPORTS
#    AS A FINDING. Latent today - every live invocation supplies the value - and
#    it is why every refusal here exits a code this module CHOOSES rather than
#    inheriting whatever the host shell does with `:?`. It is also why `--check`
#    runs each probe under BOTH shells: a single-shell control cannot see it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS FILE IS TOP-LEVEL AND NOT `scripts/lib/gate.sh`
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #1061 proposed `scripts/lib/`. Measured against a fixture tree holding
# `scripts/shellcheck-gate.sh` AND `scripts/lib/gate.sh`:
#
#   instrument-census-check.py  ->  INSTRUMENT_CENSUS_EXAMINED: 1
#   scripts-inventory-check.py  ->  SCRIPTS_INVENTORY_EXAMINED: 1, and exit ok
#
# Two shell files present, one examined, and the inventory gate reports OK.
# Both enumerate with `scripts_dir.iterdir()` filtered on `path.is_file()`, so a
# SUBDIRECTORY IS SKIPPED WHOLE. `check-negative-controls.py` is the third:
# its `DISCOVERY_SCOPE` constant states the same scope, explains that widening
# one reader without the other would split the numerator's population from the
# denominator's, and `tests/test_negative_controls.py` pins it - a marker in a
# `scripts/` subdirectory MUST NOT be discovered. Placing the wave's most
# load-bearing instrument under `scripts/lib/` would put it outside all three,
# silently. Top level is the only placement consistent with them.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY A REFUSAL IS AN `exit`, NOT A RETURN CODE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `gate_arg_value` SETS `GATE_VALUE` in the caller's shell instead of printing a
# value for `$( )` to capture. A command substitution runs in a SUBSHELL, so an
# `exit` inside one does not stop the caller - the refusal would be discarded by
# any caller who forgot `|| exit $?`, which is precisely the thing the five
# hand-written idioms depend on an author remembering. Sourced functions run in
# the caller's shell, so `exit` here really exits, and the refusal cannot be
# dropped.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOT `local`, ON PURPOSE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `local` is not POSIX and `shellcheck -s sh` rejects it. `shellcheck-gate.sh`
# is `#!/usr/bin/env sh` and runs in `koalaman/shellcheck-alpine`, which has NO
# bash, so a bash-only module would work on a dev box and be unsourceable in the
# image where the first migration target actually runs. Every helper variable
# here therefore carries a `_gate_` prefix and is a global by necessity.

# The bootstrap refusal code, used before `gate_map` has run and as the default
# `usage` mapping afterwards. 64 is sysexits.h EX_USAGE: distinct from 0 (good),
# from 1 (a finding in every gate in this tree) and from 2 and 3 (the two codes
# already in use for "could not tell"). A migrating gate that must keep its
# current number declares `usage=N` in its own `gate_map`.
GATE_USAGE_EXIT=64

# The declared mapping, as a space-delimited string. POSIX sh has no associative
# array; the leading and trailing spaces are load-bearing, because membership is
# tested as `*" name="*` and a bare `*name=*` would match `ok=` when asked about
# `k`.
GATE_MAP=""

# Set by `gate_arg_value` on success. Never read unless that call returned.

# The verdict grammar, in ONE place. `gate_map` validates what it DECLARES and
# `_gate_code_for` validates what it LOOKS UP, and until the counter-model review
# of #1126 only the first half existed. The map is a flat string, so an
# unvalidated lookup is a substring match: with ` finding=1 ok=0 usage=64 `
# declared, `gate_exit "finding=1 ok"` matched ` finding=1 ok=`, resolved to 0,
# AND EXITED 0 - an undeclared verdict reaching the good exit through the very
# function written to stop that. Measured before the fix, under sh and bash both.

# THE ONE RULE IT ENFORCES: exactly one verdict maps to exit 0. That single
# constraint IS "an unknowable answer is never rendered as a clean one" (#1014,
# #800) expressed in exit codes, and it is DERIVED rather than a hardcoded list
# of unknown-ish words - a list would go stale the first time a gate invented a
# sixth name for the third state, which is the drift this whole wave is about.
#
# It deliberately does NOT force a consumer's policy. `flow-wave-mailbox.sh`
# records that its two consumers read `unknown` in opposite directions on
# purpose - the duplicate-arm guard treats it as 0 so a wave is never blocked by
# an unavailable guard, reporting treats it as `unknown` - and collapsing that
# would erase a distinction two incidents paid for (#814, #821). The mapping is
# per gate for exactly this reason.

#
# The good verdict goes to stdout and everything else to stderr, which is the
# convention already in `shellcheck-gate.sh` and what lets a pipeline separate a
# clean run from a reported one without parsing.
# A KNOWN, MEASURED NON-ADOPTER (issue #1061). `scripts/flow-finish-gate.sh` uses
# `gate_map`, `gate_exit` and `gate_arg_value` and deliberately does NOT use this
# function. That is not an unfinished migration and should not be "completed"
# without moving what depends on it first.
#
# It emits `FLOW_FINISH_GATE: <verdict> (<detail>)` on STDOUT. This function emits
# `KEY: verdict - detail` and routes any non-zero verdict to STDERR. Both
# differences are load-bearing there, measured against its six registered controls:
#
#   parenthesised detail required   3  declared-gates, plan-reconciliation, subsumption
#   end-anchored `^...: fail$`      2  derivation, flow-finish-gate  (ANY detail breaks these)
#   unanchored, survives            1  resume
#
# So adopting it there risks FIVE of six controls, plus 85 assertions in
# tests/test_flow_finish_gate.py that read the verdict from stdout. The safety
# property #1061 exists for - one verdict maps to 0, per-verdict exit codes, and an
# unmapped verdict refusing rather than falling through - lives entirely in the
# other three functions, which that gate does adopt. This one carries a line
