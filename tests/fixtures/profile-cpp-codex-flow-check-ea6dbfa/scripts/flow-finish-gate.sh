# flow-finish-gate.sh - Deterministic quality-gate runner invocation for the
# flow commands (issue #613, the #581 pattern).
#
# Problem:
#   /flow:auto Step 6 (and the Step-7/merge re-gate, /flow:finish Step 2) run
#   the deterministic CI/CD runner as:
#
#       PYTHONPATH="$CPP_DIR:$PYTHONPATH" uv run --project "$CPP_DIR" \
#           python -m lib.cicd run --plan finish
#
#   A leading env-var assignment plus an interpolated $CPP_DIR can never match
#   a permission allow-rule PREFIX, so the line prompts as CODE-EXEC on every
#   finish and every merge re-gate. Same structural friction #581 removed from
#   Step 1 by extracting flow-start-resolve.sh: put the compound plumbing in
#   ONE audited script at a stable path, allowlist that path, invoke it BARE.
#
# What it does:
#   Resolves the CPP checkout, checks `uv`, and invokes the runner with the
#   documented PYTHONPATH / `uv run --project` contract (PYTHONPATH names the
#   PARENT of lib/ so `-m lib.cicd` resolves for external projects too, and uv
#   pins the >= 3.11 interpreter plus pydantic - issue #430). When the runner
#   is unavailable it degrades to the same Makefile gates the command docs
#   describe - `make lint`, `make test`, `make typecheck` and, since issue
#   #1147, `make verify`; with no Makefile gates either, it skips loudly. The
#   fallback mirrors the runner's `finish` plan target for target: when it ran
#   only lint + test it reproduced the exact false green the plan itself had
#   (issue #617) for every repo without uv or a CPP checkout, and when it ran
#   three of four it did the same thing again for `verify` (issue #1147).

# tell "passed cleanly" from "passed but proved nothing" from "did not run at
# all". `fail` was always distinct and is unchanged; usage errors (`exit 2`,
# below the option-parsing loop) predate this issue and are ALSO unchanged -
# do not reuse 2 for `skipped` even though the rest of this repo uses 2 for
# UNKNOWN (`shellcheck-gate.sh`, `dependency-audit.py`): 2 already means "you
# typed the flag wrong" in THIS script, and colliding the two would make a
# usage error indistinguishable from an unrunnable gate.
#
#   verdict  exit  meaning
#   -------  ----  -------
#   ok         0   ran, every gate passed, every gate actually executed
#   fail       1   ran, a gate failed

#   warn       3   ran and passed, but something is soft-bad - proceed, report it
#   skipped    4   did NOT run - no evidence either way, never a pass
#
#   warn (exit 3) is --check-summary finding gaps (advisory), OR the gate
#           passed but a gate proved nothing: a quality gate was
#           SKIPPED (issue #628 - `warn (skipped gates: ...)`),
#           a gate RAN but examined nothing (issue #1027 -
#           `warn (zero coverage: ...)`: `ruff check .` on a tree with
#           no Python files warns on stderr, prints "All checks
#           passed!" on stdout and exits 0, so a stage with no input
#           is otherwise indistinguishable from a clean one),
#           or a test step exited 0 having executed no tests
#           (issue #621), OR a failed test was re-run against only
#           its failed ids and PASSED (issue #769 - `warn (rerun
#           passed: ...)`), OR a resumed run carried a step's result
#           from an earlier invocation WITHOUT proof the tree was
#           unchanged since (issue #804 - `warn (carried, unverified:
#           ...)`). A carry the runner verified via tree_signature is
#           NOT a warning - see the #804 note below. Every
#           qualification names the reason.
#   skipped (exit 4) is no runner AND no Makefile/pyproject gates to run.
#
# `warn` and `skipped` are deliberately DIFFERENT exit codes from each other,
# not just from `ok`: "ran, passed, something is soft-bad" and "did not run,
# no evidence" are different facts a caller must be able to branch on
# separately - collapsing them into one non-zero code would fix the ok/warn
# confusion #1027 reports while creating the identical collision one level
# down.
#
# The #621/#628/#769 qualification exists because this helper is the layer the flow
# commands read: a runner that carefully reports "completed WITH WARNINGS"
# would be flattened back to a bare `ok` here, re-hiding the false green one
# level up. Both the runner and the Makefile-less fallback now prefer a gate's
# Makefile target but fall back to `uv run --extra dev <tool>` when pyproject
# configures the tool (issue #628), so a gate SKIPS only when it genuinely
# cannot run - and then it is named, never a silent ok. The warning is a
# signal, not a gate - callers should proceed on it (report it, do not stop),
# which is exactly why it needs a THIRD exit code rather than folding into
# `fail`'s 1.
#
# The #769 opt-in reaches the runner as an environment variable, not a CLI flag,
# because this helper invokes whatever CPP checkout is installed. That checkout
# may predate #769: an unknown env var is ignored, while an unknown argparse flag
# is a hard error that prevents the quality gate from running at all.
#
# #804 - a resumed run and the bare `ok` it must not print silently:
#   The runner can auto-resume a failed run from its last completed step. That
#   is correct for a crash (the tree is unchanged) and wrong for a repair (the
#   fix changed the tree, so the step that would exercise it is exactly the
#   one the resume skips). The runner now hashes the tree at persist time and
#   again before honoring a resume: a mismatch discards the stale state and
#   starts fresh, so a repair-resume can no longer print a bare `ok` while
#   carrying a stale result. This helper's job is the case the runner cannot
#   close on its own - no git, or a state file older than this field - where
#   it still resumes (so a non-git target project does not regress) but marks
#   the carry unverified. This helper turns that into `warn`, never a bare
#   `ok`, and warns ONLY on "carried AND NOT verified" - a verified carry
#   (`tree_verified: true`) is a proven-safe crash-resume, not a warning, and
#   must stay silent: this fleet's runs get killed and resumed often, and
#   warning on every legitimate one trains readers to stop reading the line.
#
# Env (test hooks - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_GATE_CPP_DIR   override the CPP checkout path (set empty to force
#                       "no checkout found" and exercise the fallback)
#   FLOW_GATE_RERUN     set to 0 to disable the #769 targeted re-run and get
#                       the pre-#769 first-failure-is-fail behaviour

# --- The shared gate conventions (issue #1061) ------------------------------
# SIBLING FIRST, like every other helper this repository resolves: a generated
# Codex skill bundles this gate under its own `scripts/`, and a gate running from
# a worktree must read THAT worktree's library rather than the primary checkout's
# through the stable path's symlink.
#
# THIS GATE ADOPTS THREE OF GATE-LIB'S FOUR FUNCTIONS, AND THE FOURTH IS
# DELIBERATELY NOT ADOPTED. `gate_map`, `gate_exit` and `gate_arg_value` carry the
# SAFETY property #1061 exists for - one verdict maps to 0, each verdict gets its
# own code, and an unmapped verdict REFUSES instead of falling through to the good
# exit. `gate_emit` carries a line FORMAT, and this gate's format is load-bearing
# published contract: it emits `FLOW_FINISH_GATE: <verdict> (<detail>)` on STDOUT,
# while gate_emit emits `KEY: verdict - detail` and routes non-zero verdicts to
# STDERR. Measured against the six `controls/flow-finish-gate*` registrations:
# THREE require the parenthesised detail (`declared-gates`, `plan-reconciliation`,
# `subsumption`) and TWO MORE are END-ANCHORED on `^FLOW_FINISH_GATE: fail$`
# (`derivation`, `flow-finish-gate` itself), which any appended detail breaks. Only
# `resume`'s unanchored regex survives a format change - so adopting gate_emit
# risks FIVE of six controls plus 85 stdout assertions in
# tests/test_flow_finish_gate.py. Do not "finish the migration" by adopting it
# without moving those first; the stopping point is a measurement, not fatigue.
# THE FILENAME IS LITERAL ON THE SOURCE LINE, and that is a requirement rather
# than a style choice (issue #1061). `codex-skill-sync.py` bundles what a skill's
# scripts need by READING them, and it can only follow a source whose target it can
# see. A computed `. "$_gate_lib"` - which this used until the bundler was taught to
# follow shell sourcing - hides the filename in an assignment above, so the
# generator would have bundled gate-lib for the four #1127 gates that spell it
# literally and silently missed it for THIS gate, the one that made the bundling
# necessary. The four existing consumers already use this idiom; matching them is
# what lets the generator's rule be a literal match rather than a shell parser.

# A MISSING LIBRARY IS FATAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS BLOCK.
# `set -e` is deliberately NOT in force in this file, so a bare `. "$missing"`
# PRINTS an error and CONTINUES - and every gate_exit call downstream then becomes
# `command not found`, which is also non-fatal. Measured on the first cut of this
# migration, in a checkout with no gate-lib reachable:

#: --- Counter-model enrolment (issue #1171) ---------------------------------
#: NEGATIVE-CONTROL: controls/counter-model-enrolment
#:
#: WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR. `counter-model-uniformity-check.py` reads the receipts
#: that EXIST. A review that never ran writes no receipt and simply shrinks the
#: population, so a SKIPPED review and a CLEAN one are the same bytes to every
#: instrument here. Measured on #1152 and #1163: both merged green with no
#: receipt, both later found to carry a HIGH. There was no per-issue enrolment -
#: nothing ever said "this issue owes a review", so nothing could say one was
#: missing. This makes absence REPRESENTABLE: every finish-mode run emits a
#: counter-model line, and no line reds the gate.
#:
#: WHY IT LIVES IN `verdict()`. Every one of the 25 verdict call sites in this
#: file is immediately followed by `exit`, so this is the one choke point a pass
#: verdict cannot get past. Enforcing at the two `verdict ok` sites instead
#: would leave `warn` and `skipped` - both of which PROCEED to a commit and a PR
#: - able to ship with no review recorded. The terminality this relies on is
#: pinned by tests/test_flow_finish_gate.py::test_every_verdict_call_is_terminal,
#: which fails if a later edit adds a verdict call that falls through.
#:
#: THE MATCH IS BY ANCESTRY, AND ANCESTRY IS NOT IDENTITY. A receipt satisfies
#: this run when its recorded `head` is the current HEAD *or an ancestor of it*.
#: So a review taken earlier on this branch still counts, and COMMITS MADE AFTER
#: THE REVIEW STILL PASS. That is a real weakening and it is written here rather
#: than only in the PR, because this comment is where the next reader meets it.
#: Strict head EQUALITY was the first design and it is unimplementable on this
#: flow: auto.md writes the receipt at :940, runs this gate at :1021, COMMITS at
#: :1097, merges origin/main at :1230 and re-runs this gate at :1240 - so
#: equality passes at :1021 and reds at :1240 on every run that reaches Step 7
#: behind main, holding a perfectly valid review. Whether a review COVERED the
#: final diff is a different instrument's subject (#1082), not this one's.
#: THIS HAPPENED DURING THE WAVE THAT SHIPPED THIS GATE, so read it as a warning
#: and not a caveat. worker-A's #1110 was reviewed clean at head 85587f11, then
#: landed material changes to the very gate logic under review - a new verdict
#: path, a new Survey field, an early return, three tests - advancing to df7ddd9
#: while its receipt still described 85587f11. 85587f11 IS an ancestor of df7ddd9,
#: so this check would have accepted that receipt and reported the PR enrolled over
#: a review that never saw the code that merges. A human caught it and re-ran the
#: review; no instrument here would have said a word. In worker-A's phrasing, such
#: a receipt is "honest about WHO reviewed and silently wrong about WHAT".
#: A tree signature is the honest tighter thing and is deliberately NOT done
#: here - it is a separate decision under ADR 0009 oscillation control, and one
#: contrary datum on the day a rule ships is not grounds to widen it.
#:
#: SCOPED TO THE BRANCH SIDE, DELIBERATELY. This runs at Step 6 and Step 7,
#: where the branch commits are still reachable. DO NOT extend this check to
#: main after a merge: CPP squash-merges, so the branch commits never land and
#: `--is-ancestor` answers NO for every one of them - a main-side copy of this
#: check would red every merged PR in the repository. Pinned by
#: controls/counter-model-enrolment case `bad-squash-merged-main-side`.
