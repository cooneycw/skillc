"""counter-model-receipt.py - record one counter-model review run (issue #934).

WHY A RECEIPT AND NOT A PR-BODY BLOCK
-------------------------------------
The stage used to record itself by appending `## Codex pre-PR review` to the PR
body, which made adoption countable by grepping merged PRs. That is a MARKER:
written by the thing being measured, and therefore defeated by whoever writes
it. PR #1000 ran two review passes, fixed eleven findings, and greps as having
had NO cross-model review, because its author rewrote the body by hand and used
a different heading. The PR block is now a RENDERING of the receipt; the receipt
is the record.

A RECEIPT IS ALSO WRITTEN ON A SKIP. A skip with a receipt is a state - it says
which reason, on which branch, at which time. A skip without one is
indistinguishable from a stage that was never wired in, which is precisely the
condition this issue was opened about: 0 of 170 merged PRs over two months, with
nothing anywhere recording that the stage had not run.

WHY IN THE REPOSITORY
---------------------
Evidence about an instrument that does not live in the tree cannot be
re-derived by anyone else: a count held outside the repo is a green nobody can
audit. One file per run, so concurrent workers never conflict on it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
It is not a gate and it returns no verdict about a change. `validate` checks
SHAPE only, and its failure is caught by the surrounding suite
(tests/test_counter_model_review.py), which is why it carries no committed
negative control of its own - see docs/decisions/0008-instrument-negative-control-bound.md
for the bound. Reading the accumulated counts is a documented `jq` query in
ADR 0007 rather than a summarising instrument here, deliberately: a number that
decides whether the stage gets promoted to blocking should be derived in the
open by whoever is deciding, not handed to them by a script nobody controlled.

#: WHICH WAY ROUND THE TWO MODELS SAT (issue #1383). The default direction -
#: Claude implements, Codex reviews - is what every receipt before #1383
#: records, and a receipt with no `direction` field still means exactly that.
#: `delegated` is the /codex:auto lane: Codex implements, and the supervising
#: Claude session reviews the diff in that lane's Step 5. Before this, the
#: writer could only model the first direction, so a delegated run had two
#: options and both were false: a `ran` receipt derived as "Codex reviewed
#: Claude's code" (inverting the property this file checks), or a skip reason
#: claiming a reviewer was absent when it was not.
#:
#: THE PROPERTY DOES NOT CHANGE WITH THE DIRECTION. Both identities are still
#: DERIVED (#1047/#1048), each from the side that produced it, and a receipt
#: naming the same model twice is refused whichever way round it claims to be.

DIRECTION_DELEGATED = "delegated"
DIRECTIONS = (DIRECTION_DEFAULT, DIRECTION_DELEGATED)

#: A skip must say WHICH skip. An open-ended reason string would let
#: "not today" and "the reviewer binary is missing" share a bucket, and those
#: two say opposite things about whether the stage is working.
#:
#: OWNER RULING 2026-09-16 (issue #1015): "the only condition for skipping a
#: codex review is the inability to run codex." Both members below ARE that
#: inability; they differ in WHICH one, which is the #953 convention applied
#: one level down - the same conclusion reached for a different cause earns a
#: reason field, not a new verdict.
#:
#: `no-diff` and `explicit-opt-out` were REMOVED. Neither is an inability to
#: run the reviewer. `explicit-opt-out` had no producer anywhere in
#: .claude/commands/, so removing it changed no behaviour - but a
#: discretionary skip is precisely the mechanism that produced 0 of 170
#: (ADR 0007), and leaving the door in the wall invites someone to open it.
#:
#: REVERSAL TRIGGER (#936, committed here rather than in a PR body the next
#: person to touch this line will not read). This change makes a check
#: STRICTER without changing what it measures, which is one of that issue's
#: own tells:
#:
#:   If runs begin stalling or failing because the reviewer is invoked on
#:   changes it cannot usefully review - an empty or near-empty diff
#:   producing `unparseable` often enough that `reviewer-unavailable` stops
#:   meaning what it says - then `no-diff` returns as a distinct reason.
#:
#:   `explicit-opt-out` does NOT return on that trigger. It was removed for a
#:   different reason (no producer), and re-adding a discretionary skip is the
#:   swing this trigger exists to catch, not one it authorises.

    `model` keys, and the FIRST is `session_meta.payload.base_instructions
    .provenance.model` - the model the base instructions were written for, not
    the model that answered. `turn_context.payload.model` is the per-turn
    record of what ran. Measured on three real runs (the default, `-m gpt-5.5`,
    `-m gpt-5`): all five agreed, so no landed receipt is wrong - but they are
    different facts, and they part on a model switch or a resumed thread.

    Refuses rather than choosing when the turns disagree: picking one of two
    would manufacture a specific answer out of an ambiguous one - the same rule
    `counter-model-reviewer-attribution.py` applies to two linked rollouts. A
    rollout with no turn_context record at all (an older Codex that wrote a
    different shape) is refused too: a receipt naming a reviewer nobody can
    re-derive is worse than no receipt.

    AGREEMENT OF WHAT WAS READ IS NOT COMPLETE EVIDENCE (counter-model review).
    A turn_context that declares no model, or a line that does not parse and
    could have been a turn record, leaves that turn's model UNKNOWN - and one
    readable turn saying `A` beside an unknown one is not a rollout that says
    `A`. Both refuse, naming the count, rather than letting the readable part
