# Changelog

All notable changes to skillc are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Dates are the day the
work landed on `main`, not the day a version is tagged - see
[#72](https://github.com/cooneycw/skillc/issues/72) for the release checklist
and version plan.

## [Unreleased]

Everything below has landed since `0.1.0` and is not yet part of a tagged
release; `0.2.0` is planned when [#10](https://github.com/cooneycw/skillc/issues/10)
(a real Docker trial end to end) closes, `0.3.0` when
[#11](https://github.com/cooneycw/skillc/issues/11) (a second independent
collection) closes.

### Added

- **Conformance through the real adapter, a no-Docker proof, and a published
  support matrix** (#80, Refs #10): interfaces.md's "Conformance cases
  required before trusting a backend" table, restated with a
  demonstrated-here / demonstrated-elsewhere / owed-to-live-run status and a
  concrete citation for every row (`tests/test_docker_conformance.py`'s
  `CONFORMANCE_CASES`, republished in
  [`docs/specs/evaluation-facility/support-matrix.md`](docs/specs/evaluation-facility/support-matrix.md)).
  The backend-owned cases run through the REAL `DockerBackend`, not an
  isolated helper - against the fake `docker` CLI, CI's own Docker-shaped
  green. `tests/test_no_docker_required.py` proves `skillc check`/`selftest`
  need no Docker at all: a committed redcase
  (`imports_docker_backend_at_load.py`) proves the "no static command
  imports the Docker backend at load" check itself can report the other
  verdict, and a positive control proves a Docker-stripped PATH actually
  makes `docker` unreachable before trusting the green run that follows.
- **The Docker backend's implementation** (Refs #77, Refs #10, on top of the
  interface above): real bodies for `prepare`/`install`/`execute`/
  `confirm_stopped`/`export`/`destroy`/`confirm_absent`, all through the
  `docker` CLI. One persistent container per attempt (`docker run -d` at
  `prepare()`, acted on afterward via `docker cp`/`docker exec` - never a
  bind mount, a shared volume or a second container), running as the fixed
  `10001:10001` candidate user. `confirm_stopped()`/`confirm_absent()` return
  `Confirmation.UNKNOWN` whenever the daemon cannot be asked at all, and a
  cleanup sweep must never reap on that answer. Proven here only against a
  fake `docker` CLI (`tests/fixtures/docker-backend/fake_docker.py`, extended
  with `exec`/`kill`/`cp`/detached `run`); the real daemon boundary remains
  owed to the operator's live run (#10). Rests on PR #83 (merged as `2fcf6a5`
  on `main`), which landed the interface this builds on.
- **The case format, `case.observes_selection`, and #39's last control**
  (Refs #26 - its no-run part; Closes #39): a trial ledger's `case` identity
  gains an optional boolean, `observes_selection` - type-checked at plan
  time (`skillc/trial.py`'s generalized `_OPTIONAL_IDENTITY`) and again on
  any already-written ledger (`skillc/records.trial_ledger`). Declaring it
  `true` makes the `skill-invocations` observation stream (#39) REQUIRED for
  that trial's attempts, not merely optional - its absence is now refused by
  `skillc/records.ledger_binding`, closing the one control #39 deferred to
  this issue. `skillc/cost_estimate.py` adds a pre-spend cost projection and
  the spend gate (`authorize`) ADR 0005 rule 5 requires: a live run may
  proceed only with an approved budget at or above the estimate, and
  separately never above the operator's own $5 ceiling for the whole run
  (relayed via master, 2026-09-26) regardless of any larger approved budget.
  `evals/selection-probe/` publishes three predeclared cases (intended use, a
  near miss, an overlapping choice), each planning BOTH matched arms
  (treatment/baseline) as its own trial and reusing the already-qualified
  `slug-small-fix` grader (#5), planned through the real controller against a
  throwaway store, with a committed run manifest (6 attempts, $0.675
  estimated) whose every published number is asserted equal to what the code
  computes. A `/codex:code_review` pass found and fixed four issues before
  push: the estimate originally priced only the treatment arm, omitting the
  baseline's own paid attempt; `authorize` accepted a NaN/infinite budget
  (a `<` comparison against NaN is always False); `estimated_usd` was rounded
  before authorization, letting a tiny positive cost round down to a
  budget-of-$0 pass; and the manifest-consistency test checked only the
  final dollar figure, not the published price/token assumptions it was
  computed from. No paid model call, live agent or image build happens
  anywhere in this work; the manifest's `execution` stays `"incomplete"`
  pending an approved budget.
- **The Docker backend's interface** (Refs #77, sub-issue of #10):
  `skillc.docker_backend.DockerBackend`'s constructor/config, `describe()`'s
  claims, the composed `docker run` argv (`compose_run_argv`, a committed
  control surface - no socket mount, no bare `-e NAME`, matched
  `--memory`/`--memory-swap`, a literal `--` before the image, per-trial
  ownership labels, an opt-in disk bound), and the handle shape. The
  candidate user is a fixed, host-independent uid:gid (`10001:10001`), never
  the host caller's own - the container's own `id`, file ownership and
  transcripts would otherwise carry a piece of the host's real identity.
  The follow-up implementation PR above fills in every lifecycle method
  beyond `describe()`.
- **Trial image and per-trial agent bootstrap** (#78, Refs #10):
  `skillc/trial_bootstrap.py` composes a private per-trial home owned by a
  fixed `candidate` (10001:10001) identity, an onboarding seed bound to
  exactly one project and the exact CLI version about to launch, never
  auto-answering anything outside the documented interactive gates, a
  per-trial MCP config declared rather than inherited, a client-aware
  invocation (`--name` only where the pinned CLI actually supports it,
  never `--remote-control`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` with no silent
  override), and a liveness canary requiring the transcript to show both a
  skill invocation and a tool use whose CONFIRMED output - never merely its
  request - carries a per-attempt nonce. `docker/trial/Dockerfile` pins the
  Claude Code and Codex CLI versions (`docker/trial/pinned-versions.json`,
  checked against the Dockerfile by `docker/trial/check_pins.py`, which
  derives each required pin from the manifest rather than a second
  hand-maintained mapping), verifies `codex-code-mode-host` lands beside the
  REAL native `codex` executable via Node's own module resolution
  (`docker/trial/verify_codex_sidecar.js`) and that no `docker` binary is
  reachable, and records a deliberate unsandboxed choice for Codex
  (`BWRAP_DECISION`). A `/codex:code_review` pass found and this PR fixed
  seven issues before push, several confirmed against the pinned CLIs'
  actual packaging and source. Consumed by `skillc/docker_backend.py` (#77);
  the image build itself and whether a real CLI starts un-wedged remain owed
  to a live Docker run (see `docker/trial/README.md`).
- **`skillc.verify` grades a probe through an `ExecutionBackend`, with a
  deterministic grading tier and a provenance stamp** (Refs #10): `grade()`/
  `grade_files()` accept an optional backend for stage 1 (the untrusted
  probe) - `None` keeps today's bare-subprocess path unchanged; stage 2 (the
  trusted judge) never changes either way. Adds `skillc/provenance.py`
  (`skillc_version`, source commit and dirty state, stamped from the
  package's own version - see `#73` above).
- **Self-maintaining version and README instruments** (#73): `skillc.__version__`
  reads `pyproject.toml`'s `version` through the package's own installed
  metadata instead of a second literal; `skillc --version`; this changelog and
  its CI gate; README drift checks (commands, version, status vs. a committed
  milestones file).
- **`skillc leak-check`** (#63): refuses a tree or a produced bundle carrying a
  machine identity - a home-directory path, a `uid=`/`gid=` number, a private
  (RFC 1918) IPv4 address, or a hostname from a locally-configured deny-list.
  Wired into CI on the whole repository tree, with its own negative control.
- **A second, independently-authored subject** (#11): mattpocock/skills,
  proving `skillc materialize`'s "generic by declaration" design against a
  collection with a bucketed layout, a manifest-scoped shipped surface and
  Codex-native invocation metadata - no adapter change needed.
- **`skillc check --manifest`** (#53): scopes a check to a plugin manifest's
  declared skills (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), reporting the undeclared
  remainder as a count instead of mixing shipped and draft skills into one
  total.
- **`skillc check --json`, a repair-hint consumer, and a clean packaged
  install proof** (#27): machine-readable findings for tool consumption, and
  `ci/clean-install-check.sh`, which builds a real wheel into a fresh venv and
  proves `skillc selftest`/`check` behave the same as the source checkout.
- **`invocation-consistency`** (#50): a new rule comparing Claude Code's
  `disable-model-invocation` (`SKILL.md`) against Codex's
  `policy.allow_implicit_invocation` (`agents/openai.yaml`), refusing to treat
  an unreadable second-client file as agreement.
- **`skill-invocations`, an optional declared observation** (#39): gives
  "skill actually invoked" its own place in the evaluation record contracts,
  so "available but never invoked" no longer has to be re-derived from raw
  events outside any rule.
- **The execution backend seam and lifecycle driver** (#65, #70, Refs #10): a
  `Protocol`-based `ExecutionBackend` and `skillc/lifecycle.py`, which drives
  one attempt through prepare/install/execute/confirm_stopped/export/destroy/
  confirm_absent/finalize against a real backend, with a nonce liveness canary.
- **Native materialization and a proven clean baseline** (#7): `skillc
  materialize` installs a declared skill surface into disposable homes and
  proves what a real client lists, against the first subject (CPP's native
  Codex skills).
- **Independent grading and adversarial evaluator controls** (#9): the
  disposable-copy verifier and result assembler (`skillc/verify.py`).
- **Controller-owned trial accounting and artifact capture** (#8): the
  population planner and capture controller (`skillc/trial.py`).
- **The Level 1 slug-fix goal and a proven grader** (#5): the first
  independently-checkable goal-based task, with a certified grader and its own
  broken-grader controls.
- **Version 2 of all four evaluation record contracts** (#4), later joined by
  `attempt-lifecycle` (#8): the installation receipt, trial ledger, artifact
  manifest and verified result, each with discriminating rule controls under
  `skillc check-records`.
- **`ref-depth` counts a back-link to `SKILL.md` or an already-linked sibling
  as ordinary, not a deeper chain** (#52), and reports every distinct chain,
  not just the first.
- **`trigger-shape` stays silent on a user-invoked skill under
  `--target claude-code`** (#51): the model cannot fire a skill declaring
  `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the premise the rule warns under does
  not hold for that client; `--target portable` is unchanged. `skillc
  selftest` itself became target-aware to prove this (`controls/<rule>/
  targets/<target>/`).
- **Frontmatter types, a documented YAML subset, and target-scoped field
  rules** (#3): `name`/`description` must be strings; `--target portable`
  (the Agent Skills specification) vs. `--target claude-code` (plus its
  documented extensions).
- **`skillc selftest` refuses an empty, unparsed or misattributed control, and
  an unknown `--rule`** (#2): a rule with no committed control is `UNPROVEN`,
  not silently passing.
- **A pinned research trail**: provenance notes and adopted-concept maps for
  [Coder Eval](docs/research/coder-eval-lessons.md) (#6),
  [config-drift-checker](docs/research/config-drift-checker-lessons.md)
  (#38, #40), and [mattpocock/skills](docs/research/mattpocock-skills-lessons.md)
  (#49), each naming the pinned commit and licence per
  [ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-no-external-evaluation-runtime.md) (ideas,
  never code).

### Fixed

- A non-boolean criterion `mandatory` flag is refused, not silently dropped
  from the derivation (#37).
- `tests/` is inside `mypy`'s scope, with a control that plants a type error
  there and requires it reported (#19).
- The fixture pin is computed without needing a `git` binary at import time
  (#5 follow-up).

### CI / process

- Woodpecker gate (`selftest`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`) with its own negative
  control (#18), a gitleaks secret scan with a negative control (#43, #47),
  and now `leak-check` (#63) and this changelog gate (#73), each proven able
  to report the failing verdict, not only the passing one.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-15

The static checker: `skillc check`, `skillc selftest`, `skillc rules`. Every
rule ships a committed redcase (ADR 0001) and `skillc selftest` proves each one
can still report the other verdict. Tagged retroactively at
